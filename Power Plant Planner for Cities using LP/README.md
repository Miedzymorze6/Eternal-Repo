This Python script is designed to model the energy production and optimization for a fictional city, taking into account various energy generation assets such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, coal, gas, and nuclear. The program uses linear programming (via the pulp library) to determine the optimal mix of energy assets that will meet the city's energy demand while adhering to constraints like budget and development time. The script also considers weather factors, environmental penalties, and repair costs when predicting energy production and calculating the overall costs.

Key Features:
Asset Properties: Different types of energy assets with properties like cost, environmental penalties, repair costs, and development time.
Energy Prediction: A function to predict energy production for each asset type, adjusted by the weather factor.
Linear Optimization: Uses pulp.LpProblem to minimize the lifecycle cost (capital cost, repair cost, environmental penalty) while ensuring that the total energy produced meets or exceeds the city's energy demand and remains within the available budget.
Development Time Management: Allows for booster units that reduce the development time of energy assets.
Results Display: Once the optimization problem is solved, the program displays the selected assets, their quantities, and a detailed cost breakdown (capital cost, repair cost, environmental penalty cost).
Structure:
Predict Energy: A function predict_energy is used to calculate the energy output of each asset based on its type and a weather factor.
Main Optimization: The main function defines city configurations and assets, calculates effective development times, and uses linear programming to optimize the asset selection process.
Linear Programming Problem: The optimization problem is framed to minimize the cost while respecting constraints like energy demand, budget, and development time.
Output: After solving the problem, it displays the status, selected assets, cost breakdown, and total energy production.
Requirements:
pulp (for linear programming)
Python 3.x
This program is useful for simulations where energy supply must be optimized based on cost, efficiency, and environmental impact. It can be expanded for more complex city planning scenarios or real-world energy management applications.
