**EV Charging Station Placement Optimization**

**Overview**
This project optimizes the placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in a given city using geospatial data, multi-criteria scoring, and integer linear programming (ILP). The goal is to maximize accessibility by considering factors such as:

Proximity to downtown (centrality)
Distance from major roads
Population density
Business/commercial centers
The solution selects the best K locations while ensuring a minimum distance between stations.

**Features**
âœ… Download and process road network data using OSMnx (Poznan used as a reference)
âœ… Compute candidate locations and evaluate site suitability
âœ… Optimize station placement using ILP (PuLP)
âœ… Visualize results with Folium on an interactive map

**How It Works**

1. Data Collection & Candidate Extraction
Downloads road network data for a specified city (default: PoznaÅ„, Poland)
Samples 500 random candidate locations from the network
2. Score Computation
Each candidate location is evaluated based on:
âœ” Centrality: Closer to downtown = higher score
âœ” Road Proximity: Near major roads = higher score
âœ” Population Density: Closer to high-population areas = higher score
âœ” Business Centers: Near commercial hubs = higher score

3. Optimization using Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
Selects K optimal locations
Ensures a minimum distance (D_min) constraint between stations
4. Visualization
Generates an interactive Folium map with:
âšª Candidate locations (gray)
ðŸ”´ Selected optimal charging stations (red)
Running the Script

**Final Steps**

After execution, the optimized station placements will be saved in:
âœ… ev_stations_map.html (interactive visualization)
